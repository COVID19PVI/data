# COVID-19 Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) Dashboard

This is the data repository for the [COVID-19 Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) Dashboard](https://toxpi.org/covid-19/map/).  
## Quick Start Guide

The [Quick Start](https://toxpi.org/covid-19/) guide provides an overview of using the Dashboard.

## Documentation of Data Sources and Rationale

The current PVI model documentation, including data sources and performance evaluation, is available on the Dashboard [Details](https://toxpi.org/covid-19/) page.

## Data

The series of all daily PVI model files are posted in folders according to `<model-identifier>`. PVI model formulation (e.g. reapportionment of weights or incorporation of new source data) will change as new research advances our understanding of factors associated with vulnerability. Models will be enumerated sequentially, so the highest-numbered model will always be our current/working version.

> **Results** files can be uploaded into the Dashboard. **Results** files are named as:</n>
>  `<model-identifier>_results_<date>.csv`.
>  
> **Data** files contain "raw" data prior to transformation into PVI using the [ToxPi  GUI](https://toxpi.org/). **Data** files can be manipulated using the [ToxPi  GUI](https://toxpi.org/) to generate new **Results** files for upload into the Dashboard. **Data** files are named as:</n>
>  `<model identifier>_data_<date>.csv`.
