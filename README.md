# COVID-19 Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) Dashboard

This is the data repository for the [COVID-19 Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) Dashboard](https://covid19pvi.niehs.nih.gov/).  
## Quick Start Guide

The [Quick Start](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/coronavirus/covid19pvi/) guide provides an overview of using the Dashboard.

## Documentation of Data Sources and Rationale

The current PVI model documentation, including data sources and performance evaluation, is available on the Dashboard [Details](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/coronavirus/covid19pvi/details/) page.

## Data

The series of all daily PVI model files are posted in folders according to `<model-identifier>`. PVI model formulation (e.g. reapportionment of weights or incorporation of new source data) will change as new research advances our understanding of factors associated with vulnerability. [Model11.2](https://github.com/COVID19PVI/data/tree/master/Model11.2) is the current PVI model displayed in the Dashboard.

> **Results** files can be uploaded into the Dashboard. **Results** files are named as:</br>
>  `<model-identifier>_results_<date>.csv`.
>  
> **Data** files contain "raw" data prior to transformation into PVI using the [ToxPi  GUI](https://toxpi.org/). **Data** files can be manipulated using the [ToxPi  GUI](https://toxpi.org/) to generate new **Results** files for upload into the Dashboard. **Data** files are named as:</br>
>  `<model identifier>_data_<date>.csv`.
