# COVID-19 Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) Dashboard

This is the public repository for the [COVID-19 Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) Dashboard](https://covid19pvi.niehs.nih.gov/).  
## Quick Start Guide

The [Quick Start](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/coronavirus/covid19pvi/) guide provides an overview of using the Dashboard.

## Documentation of Data Sources and Rationale

The current PVI model documentation, including data sources and performance evaluation, is available on the Dashboard [Details](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/coronavirus/covid19pvi/details/) page.

## Data

The series of all daily PVI model files are posted in folders according to `<model-identifier>`. PVI model formulation (e.g. reapportionment of weights or incorporation of new source data) will change as new research advances our understanding of factors associated with vulnerability. [Model11.2.1](https://github.com/COVID19PVI/data/tree/master/Model11.2.1) is the current PVI model displayed in the Dashboard.

> **Results** files can be uploaded into the Dashboard. **Results** files are named as:</br>
>  `<model-identifier>_results_<date>.csv`.
>  
> **Data** files contain "raw" data prior to transformation into PVI using the [ToxPi  GUI](https://toxpi.org/). **Data** files can be manipulated using the [ToxPi  GUI](https://toxpi.org/) to generate new **Results** files for upload into the Dashboard. **Data** files are named as:</br>
>  `<model identifier>_data_<date>.csv`.

## Methods

Details of statistical methods are maintained in [Supplemental Methods](https://github.com/COVID19PVI/data/blob/master/COVID19PVI%20Supplemental%20Github.pdf).

## Outreach & Education

A set of [COVID-19 PVI Lesson Plans](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/scied/teachers/covid-19/index.cfm), "Examining Risk Factors Associated With COVID-19 Using the Pandemic Vulnerability Index", has been developed by NIEHS for High School educators and students.

## Additional Resources

The COVID-19 Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) Dashboard is mirrored as a [Unique Populations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#pandemic-vulnerability-index) resource as part of the [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker)
